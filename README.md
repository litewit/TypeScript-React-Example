# TypeScript-React-Webpack-Example

### Install our dependencies
First ensure Webpack is installed globally.

`npm install -g webpack`

Webpack is a tool that bundle code and optionally all of its dependencies into a single .js file. In our case its `bundle.js`



Just run:

`webpack`

Now open up index.html in your favorite browser and everything should be ready to use! You should see a page that says “Hello from LiteWit,  TypeScript and React!”
